This makes one gallon of sweet tea. Baking soda takes any of the bitterness out of your tea. It is great for other uses as well. If you are soaking beans overnight and are putting them in a pot to make the next day, add a small dash of baking soda to your pot before cooking. It keeps beans tasting their best."]},{"l":"Nutritional Disclaimer","p":["“The Country Cook” is not a dietician or nutritionist, and any nutritional information shared is an estimate.
